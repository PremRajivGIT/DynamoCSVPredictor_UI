## üöÄ Project Overview

The **Real Estate Price Predictor** is a sophisticated, user-friendly web application built with Gradio that leverages machine learning to forecast property prices. It supports both a built-in California Housing dataset (transformed to Indian Rupees for broader appeal) and custom CSV uploads for personalized predictions. Powered by a Gradient Boosting Regressor model from scikit-learn, this tool provides accurate price estimates based on key housing features like median income, house age, room counts, population, and location.

This project is designed for real estate enthusiasts, data scientists, and developers who want to experiment with regression models in a visually stunning, noir-gold themed interface. The app includes dynamic sliders for input, real-time previews, and robust error handling.

### Key Highlights
- **Animated UI Elements**: Sliders with smooth transitions, loading animations, and predictive output reveals (suggest using CSS/JS for full animation in deployment).
- **Dataset Flexibility**: Switch between pre-loaded data or upload your own CSV.
- **Model Performance**: Achieves high R¬≤ scores (typically ~0.84 on California data) with detailed metrics.
- **Currency Conversion**: Prices predicted in INR (Indian Rupees) for global relevance.
- **Open-Source**: Fully customizable with detailed code breakdowns.

## üìã Features in Detail

### 1. **Dataset Selection**
   - **Built-in California Housing Dataset**: 
     - Fetched via scikit-learn's `fetch_california_housing()`.
     - 20,640 samples with 8 features: MedInc, HouseAge, AveRooms, AveBedrms, Population, AveOccup, Latitude, Longitude.
     - Target: Median house value converted to INR (multiplied by 100,000 * 83 for approximate conversion).
     - Auto-trains a model upon loading with R¬≤ ~0.8420.
   - **Custom CSV Upload**:
     - Supports any CSV with numeric/categorical columns.
     - Automatic detection of features and target (last column assumed as target).
     - Handles missing values with mean imputation and one-hot encoding for categoricals.
     - Preview shows first 5 rows, total rows/columns, and column names.

### 2. **Model Training**
   - Uses **GradientBoostingRegressor** with optimized hyperparameters:
     - `n_estimators=500` (or 300 for custom datasets).
     - `learning_rate=0.1`, `max_depth=5` (or 4), `min_samples_split=5`, `min_samples_leaf=2`.
   - Data preprocessing: Standard scaling, train-test split (80/20).
   - Metrics calculated: R¬≤, Adjusted R¬≤, Explained Variance, MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, MSLE, Max Error.
   - Model, scaler, and metadata saved as PKL files for persistence.

### 3. **Prediction Interface**
   - Dynamic sliders generated based on selected features, with min/max/default/step values tailored to data ranges.
   - Real-time prediction on slider changes.
   - Output formatted as "‚ÇπX,XXX,XXX.XX" with error handling.

### 4. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - **Noir Gold Theme**: Dark background (#0A0A0A) with gold accents (#FFD700) for a premium feel.
   - **Animations**: Button hovers, slider drags, and status updates with fade-ins (implement via Gradio's CSS theming or external JS).
   - **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop/mobile.
   - **Status Feedback**: Detailed logs in a textbox for loading/training success/errors.

### 5. **Advanced Capabilities**
   - Handles categorical data via one-hot encoding.
   - Imputes missing values automatically.
   - Supports up to 10 features for sliders (hides extras).
   - API-ready: Use via Gradio's built-in API for integration.

2. Click **Preview CSV** to see data summary.
3. Select features (checkboxes) and target (dropdown).
4. Click **Train Model**.
5. Use sliders to predict.

### Example CSV Structure
```

- **app.py**: Gradio interface logic, including dynamic sliders, theming, and prediction functions.
- **requirements.txt**: Minimal dependencies for easy setup.

### Customization Tips
- **Add Animations**: Use Gradio's `css` parameter or integrate Lottie files for JSON animations.
- **Extend Model**: Swap GradientBoosting for XGBoost or Neural Nets by modifying `train.py`.
